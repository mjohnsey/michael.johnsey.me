      Moved my wedding website off of Squarespace and into a [basic Jekyll site](https://wedding.johnsey.me){:target="_blank"} hosted on Github Pages. Not nearly as pretty but a decent way to capture the content and host for free.

      My main responsibility is working with partners who want to use the engine that empowers [Speedtest](https://speedtest.net){:target="_blank"} in the form of SDKs, APIs, and embedded integrations.
