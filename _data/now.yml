      Continuing to work on this website.

      Been following [TRTLCoin](https://turtlecoin.lol), there is a good getting started [here](https://turtleturtle.surge.sh). The [Discord](http://chat.turtlecoin.lol) is a good community to join to learn more as well.

      Also been looking at volunteering some time for [Run for Something](https://www.runforsomething.net) which helps people who want to run for office for the first time.
