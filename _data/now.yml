      Continuing to work on this website.

      Been following [TRTLCoin](https://turtlecoin.lol){:target="_blank"}, there is a good getting started [here](https://turtleturtle.surge.sh){:target="_blank"}. The [Discord](http://chat.turtlecoin.lol){:target="_blank"} is a good community to join to learn more as well.

      Also been looking at volunteering some time for [Run for Something](https://www.runforsomething.net){:target="_blank"} which helps people who want to run for office for the first time.

      Moved my wedding website off of Squarespace and into a [basic Jekyll site](https://wedding.johnsey.me){:target="_blank"} hosted on Github Pages. Not nearly as pretty but a decent way to capture the content and host for free.
