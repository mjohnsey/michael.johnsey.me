Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are a simple concept that does heavy lifting, all the best concepts share this commonality.

The TLDR goes something like: Objectives and Key Results are a tool used to create alignment in an organization, by setting goals and establishing what success will look like when you achieve that goal.

## Objectives and Key Results

The OKR system was formalized by the management legend Andy Grove in the 1970s. OKRs are finding their place in the spotlight because they were brought to early-Google in 1999 by VC John Doerr and have been done by Google employees every year since introduction.

### Objectives

Objectives should be ambitious, actionable, time-boxed, and qualitative goals you wish to accomplish.

### Key Results

Key Results should be 2-3 quantitative measures that define if the Objective was completed successfully. Oftentimes, Key Results will be either yes/no (E.g. Did X happen?) or numbers you are trying to meet (E.g. 1 million daily-active-users).

### An Example Using a Hotel

Here's an example set of Objectives and Key Results that a hotel might make at the beginning of a quarter.

- Objective: Increase international guest bookings.

  - Key Result: Check-in 100 guests from outside the country using their passports.
  - Key Result: Check-in guests from 5 different countries.

- Objective: Have more guests eat breakfast at the hotel restaurant.
  - Key Result: Increase revenue from breakfast by 20%.
  - Key Result: Increase average number of guests served breakfast daily to 25.
