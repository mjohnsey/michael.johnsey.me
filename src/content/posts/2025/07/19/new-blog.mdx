description: "How I setup my new blog"

I recently set up this new incarnation of my website using <a href="https://astro.build" target="_blank">Astro</a>, after years of neglect on <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll works great but it was a little heavy handed for what I used it for and I've been living my life more and more in React world (with Tailwind) so this move made sense for me.

I never had much content on my website, so the switch was pretty simple. Just copied over a handful of old posts which were already in Markdown so it was easy to get it over into Astro.

CSS has been my weak point for a long time but Tailwind has made my life so much easier in that regard, hard to imagine going back to regular CSS after using Tailwind for a while. So now instead of needing to find the perfect template for my site in Jekyll or Hugo or similar, I threw my own together in about an hour with Tailwind and it works great for this simple site.
