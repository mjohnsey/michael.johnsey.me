# Debug the Future

## Talk Synopsis
A non-partisan exploration of how technology skills can impact politics, elections, and government. Learn how your tech expertise can make a difference in modern democracy. This talk will not focus on any specific parties or candidates, and all perspectives are welcome as long as they are shared respectfully.
