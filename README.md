This is a jekyll static site. Fun stuff can be found in the `Makefile`.

## How to get certificate

This is being served with Let's Encrypt and you have to run it manually when you are serving out of S3.

```shell
make update-cert
```

This command will spit out a key + value that you have to store in your S3 bucket in the `.well-known/acme-challenge` folder while running through the updater.

## Acknowledgments
